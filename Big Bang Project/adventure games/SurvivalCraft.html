<p><b>Survival Craft</b> is a sandbox game where the player crafts tools such as an axe and a shovel, weapons and even wearables in order to survive in the jungle. Gather the necessary materials to craft any item.</p>
<p>Do not forget to construct buildings for yourself to take shelter. Create an environment for yourself where you can survive under the harsh conditions of raw nature! </p>
<h4>How to Play Survival Craft</h4>
<ul>
<li>You will find yourself with nothing in your pocket in an open world.</li>
<li>In the forest, you can find oak trees, pine trees, rocks, flying birds, and lakes for fishing.</li>
<li>Before crafting any necessary item for yourself, take a look around.</li>
<li>Collect things that might be useful to you.</li>
<li>The first thing you will need most is an axe.</li>
<li>Open the crafting section by clicking on the icon in the lower-left corner of the screen.</li>
<li>You will see many categories here. Learn which materials are needed to craft anything in this section.</li>
<li>You can start by tapping on the tools section and choosing the axe. You need wood and a rock to craft it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Getting Started: Crafting Items</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Exploring the forest and gathering resources are your first tasks.</li>
    <li>Craft yourself an axe to obtain more wood from trees.</li>
    <li>You will also need to use the axe to get rocks from the small cliffs. So, your most fundamental tool is an axe to collect stuff.</li>
    <li>Other than these materials, collect grasses, blackberries, and corn.</li>
    <li>You may even catch fish from the lake. But you will need a fishing rod to do that.</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Build A Shelter</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Building a shelter is essential for your character's survival. A shelter will protect him from dangers and provide a safe place to rest.</li>
        <li>Before construction, you need to craft basic materials such as wood, stone, and grass.</li>
        <li>Obtain wood by chopping down trees with your trusty axe. Find stones by mining rocks with your pickaxe. And harvest grass from the ground using an axe.</li>
        <li>Once you have collected these materials, you can use them to build a shelter, hut, cabin, wood decks, and even an alchemy station.</li>
        <li>For a basic shelter, start by collecting 5 decks wood to create a foundation. Craft a rope made of grass. You will need it to combine parts of your shelter.</li>
        <li>As you progress in the game, you can upgrade your shelter. You can also build a proper house by crafting parts of walls and roofs.</li>
        <li>Master the art of building. Then you can make home as comfortable and functional as it can be for your character in this challenging wilderness.</li>
        <li>For example, you can build a furnace to cook food or construct a workshop station where you can craft more advanced tools and equipment.</li>
        <li>So gather your tools, collect resources. Let your creativity soar as you work on the perfect place in this vast and untamed world.</li>
    </ul>
<h4>Controls</h4>
<ul>
<li>To move the farmer, use the WASD keys.</li>
<li>Use your mouse to craft items.</li>
<li>Use the right mouse click to equip, drop, or eat an item or sow seeds.</li>
</ul>
