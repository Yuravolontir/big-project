You can also improve your character's skills from the inventory section.</p>
<h4>Red Cloaked Enemies</h4>
<p>You will encounter red-cloaked enemies along the platform. They will do their best to harm you. You may take damage while fighting them. But don't worry. You can find potions to replenish your health on the platform. You can check your character's health status from the red bar at the top left of the screen.</p>
