<p>As you drive through heavy traffic, you'll have the same opportunity to cut up cars and make your way to the top as you did before in other traffic games. But this time, we've taken it to the next level with a range of features that will take your gameplay to the extreme.</p>
<h4>How to Play Highway Racer Pro</h4>
<ul>
<li>To start your dodging in-traffic adventure, first, hop into the garage and choose your ride.</li>
<li>You can customize your car to suit your style, whether you're a speed demon or a drifting master.
</li>
<li>Once you've got your car just right, you're ready to select a road to match your gameplay preferences.
</li>
<li>Highway Racer Pro offers four unique roads to put your driving skills to the test.
<ul>
    <li><b>One Way:</b> Take it easy and get familiar with the game in this relaxed mode.
    </li>
    <li><b>Two Way:</b> Reverse the direction and earn bigger rewards, but be prepared for increased risk.
    </li>
    <li><b>Time Attack:</b> Show off your skills in this 100-second sprint, performing daring stunts and maneuvers.
    </li>
    <li><b>Speed Bomb:</b> Keep your speed up or risk exploding - it's a road of challenge!
    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remember, no matter which mode you choose, your goal is to <b>drive as long as possible.</b>
</li>
<li>You'll be earning coins by performing near-misses, speeding, and driving in the wrong direction.
</li>
<li>Keep an eye on your health bar at the bottom - collisions will drain it, and when it's gone, your ride ends.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Online Multiplayer Racing
</h4>
<p>In the Multiplayer mode of Highway Racer Pro, invite friends to join you in a shared traffic environment. Create a room, pick your car, and compete to see who can master the chaos of this crowded highway. With friends as your rivals, you'll need to stay sharp and focused to come out on top.
</p>
<h4>Grip or Drift?
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Get under the hood of your car and fine-tune its performance to suit your driving style.
</li>
<li>Adjust the suspension, camber, and tire settings to boost grip and stability at high speeds.
</li>
<li>Or, if drifting is your thing, tweak the rear and front heights, spring force, and damp levels to make your car slide like a pro.
</li>
<li>If you're new to tuning, don't worry - we've got an ultimate guide for tuning to help you get started.
</li>
</ul>
