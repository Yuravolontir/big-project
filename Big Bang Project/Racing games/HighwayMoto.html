<h4>How to Play Highway Moto
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Highway Moto puts you in the driver's seat of a powerful motorbike.
</li>
<li>Just like food delivery guys racing against time and traffic, open your way out in the rush hour of a highway.
</li>
<li>Start by accelerating with the W key or up arrow, and steer left or right using the A/D keys or arrow keys to avoid any crashes.
</li>
<li>If things get too slow, perform a wheelie with the Left-Shift key.
</li>
<li>The traffic will not be too intense at first, but when you reach a certain distance and speed, it'll all be crazy.
</li>
<li>You can use the spacebar to honk and clear the road ahead of slower vehicles. But remember, as in real life, some drivers don't care about horns and keep going.
</li>
<li>Lane-splitting is your best friend in this bike game. Take advantage of the narrow width of your bike to weave through traffic. But there will be some vehicles (especially trucks) suddenly changing lanes. So keep your defensive as well.  
</li>
<li>Just remember you must be sharp to master the traffic and make it out alive! One wrong move, and it's game over!
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Game Features
</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Three game modes:<b>Traffic Time</b> for near misses,<b>Traffic Ride</b> or the longest distance score, and <b>Free Ride</b> to cruise on a traffic-free highway.</li>
    <li>Well-crafted realistic graphics and controls give you an even more immersive feeling.
    </li>
    <li>Upgrade system where you start with a basic bike and unlock more advanced models as you progress.
    </li>

</ul>
