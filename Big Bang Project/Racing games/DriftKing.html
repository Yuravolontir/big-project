<h4>How To Play Drift King</h4>
<p>The traditional approach in a car game would be to give zero cash to the player at the beginning. This means waiting and playing for a long time to use any cool feature a game might offer. However, we told you Drift King is different. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drift King puts 30,000 coins in your pocket, right as you enter the game. This allows you to buy most of the cars in the garage, upgrade the parts, and tune them as you like before you.</li>

<li>If you're not sure how to tune your car, find our complete guide on tuning. </li>
<li>Then move on to maps. You have six options in the maps section. </li>
<li>Select a map that will describe your drifting experience, your environment preferences, and what you expect from the game.</li>
<li>Some of maps have racetracks while some are long countryside roads with slight curves. It's up to you.</li>
<li>If you spawn onto the map, now aim for the longest drift. Keep the speed high and perform manji drifts and donuts. Or go freestyle and follow the curves of the road while leaving S-shaped marks behind you.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Explore Garage</h4>
<p>In the garage, there are a bunch of options to customize your car to your liking.</p>
<ul>
    <li>You can upgrade car parts such as the engine, turbo, gearbox, handling, and weight.
    </li>
    <li>Paint your car in any color you like
    </li>
    <li>Tune front and rear heights and cambers, and adjust brake sensitivity. 
    </li>
    <li>Buy cool wheels with your in-game currency.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Multiplayer Drifting</h4>
<p>One of the coolest features Drift King has its multiplayer rooms. After you select multiplayer mode, enter your nickname, choose a map and create a room to hang out with your drifter friends. Race with each other, make drifting competitions or chase after each other to experience crashes and chaos.  </p>
